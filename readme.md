# Inefficient ordering

Somewhat inspired by this beautiful video of computer sorting algorithms, I set out to write my own. Knowing full well that I would likely discover a method that performs worse, I leaned into the wind.

My sorting algorithm takes a random arrangement of the integers up to the vectorâ€™s length and rearranges the original list in this order, repeating until the list is in order.

On average, this should perform in the order of O(n!)_!_


```
inefficient_sort <- function(x) {
    
    if (length(x) == 1) {
        return(x)
    }
    
    solve <- x
    in_order <- all(solve[1:(length(x) - 1)] < solve[2:length(x)])
    
    while (!in_order) {
        solve <- x[sample(x = 1:length(x), size = length(x),
                          replace = FALSE)]
        in_order <- all(solve[1:(length(x) - 1)] < solve[2:length(x)])
    }
    
    return(solve)
    
}
```

Using the microbenchmark package, this is, on average, circa 300,000 times slower than the default sort function.

```
library(microbenchmark)

microbenchmark(inefficient_sort(x), sort(x), times = 10)
 
Unit: microseconds
                 expr         min          lq         mean      median           uq          max
 inefficient_order(x) 3454323.589 5831976.813 25708513.570 9451126.667 32137622.969 96802481.587
              sort(x)      48.641      65.599       96.256      96.613      132.982      137.444
 neval
    10
    10
```

Still works though.
